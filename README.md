# QGIS-Map-Production-Automation

QGIS plug in which automates the production of Active Travel Zone maps. 

Custom GUI which requires user to input site location co-ordinates and folder location. 

Travel Time ischrones are created for walking and cycling, and then constraints are selected which fall within those areas.

Output of three maps as image files and as QGIS map document files, are as follows:

"Map 1 - Active Travel Zone"

"Map 2 - Neighbourhood & Most Important Journey"

"Map 3 - Neighbourhood Safety"

All QGIS map documents contain pre loaded extents and symbology files applied, and layers can be added or removed at will.

In addition the map document will contain a pre loaded layout file, so the user can adjust titles or add additional items such as client logo.

The plugin also generates file folders for storing of data and outputs, so all data can easily be found and inspected.
